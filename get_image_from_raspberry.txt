1) capture image, to file, and copy it
    -login to raspberry over ssh
    -capture image:
        raspistill -o /home/pi/image.jpg <add some parameters>
    -copy image, to local directory:
        pscp -pw password pi@123.456.789.123:/home/pi/image.jpg /local/directory/image.jpg
    -read image, for further analyze
    
    
2) get image over tcp
    -run server on raspberry, which let us, to capture data
    -send command over tcp, with setup for camera
    -send command over tcp, to get image directly from server (image is captured and send to client)
    
-for both method, we need at first find raspberry ip address
